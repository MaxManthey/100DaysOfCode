# [100 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com)

Start: 16.Feb.2021  
End: 27.May.2021  
  
I will code for at least one hour every day for 100 days in a row. I do this to learn new skills, improve existing skills and create real world projects that help me better understand all parts of development.  
  
This repository will be my main canvas for said challenge, however I might contribute to other repositories that are private.  
Any missed days will be listed below
