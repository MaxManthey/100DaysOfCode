# [100 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com)

Start: 16.Feb.2021  
End: 27.May.2021  
  
I will code for at least one hour every day for 100 days in a row. I do this to learn new skills, improve existing skills and create real world projects that help me better understand all parts of development.  
  
This repository will be my main canvas for said challenge, however I might contribute to other private repositories.  
  
Project difficulties:  
e - easy (Projects that should be easy to me / I have done something like this before)  
i - intermediate (Projects that are a bit trickier but still in my comfort zone and shouldn't be too hard to do)  
a - advanced (Projects that are out of my comfort zone to extend my skills in certain areas)
